the following features to the existing GUI.
 Remove all command console output and provide functionality and feedback for
all commands within the GUI window.
 Change the DVD Manager main program to only show the GUI and remove the
option to show the command line interface.
 Provide a list of DVDs (from the DVD array) so the user can select one of them
for show and editing.
 Provide a means to select a DVD from the array and functionality to display the
DVD information including title, rating and total running time to the screen using
the GUI components.
 Provide a means to easily edit the DVD information for each of the titles in the
DVD list.
